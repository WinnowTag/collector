Story: Feed Management

    As a User
    I want to add feeds
    So I can get content
    
    Scenario: Adding a feed
    
        Given no feeds
        And no item caches
    
        When I add the feed 'http://slashdot.org
    
        Then there is another feed in the system
        And I am redirected to the feed
        
    Scenario: Adding a feed to an item cache
    
        Given no feeds
        And 1 item cache
        
        When I add the feed 'http://slashdot.org'
        
        Then the feed is published to the item cache
