Story: Feed Management

    As a User
    I want to add feeds
    So I can get content
    
    Scenario: Adding a feed
    
        Given no feeds
        And no item caches
        And I am a logged in user
    
        When I add the feed http://example.org
    
        Then I'm redirected to the feed
        And there is another feed in the system
        
    Scenario: Adding a feed to an item cache
    
        Given no feeds
        And 1 item cache
        
        When I add the feed http://example.org
        
        Then I'm redirected to the feed
        And there is another feed in the system
        And the feed is published to the item cache
