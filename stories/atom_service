Story: Atom Client Access

  As another system
  I want to be able to access feeds and items using atom
  So that I can cache feeds and items in my own format
  
  Scenario: Accessing the service description

    Given existing feeds in the system    
    And a base url
    
    When I fetch the service document    
    
    Then the document should have a workspace
    And  the workspace should have a title
    And  the workspace should have a collection for each feed
    And  the collections should have titles for each of the feeds
  
  Scenario: Accessing a feed
    Given feed 1 in the system
    And a base url
    
    When I fetch the service document
    And  I fetch the feed for the first collection
    
    Then the feed contains the items
    And  it contains the title
    And  the id fragment matches the feed id
    And  fetching self returns an Atom::Feed
  
  Scenario: Accessing an item for a feed
    Given feed 1 in the system
    And a base url
    And item 1 of the feed
    
    When I fetch the service document
    And I fetch the feed for the first collection
    And item 1 of the feed
        
    Then  it contains the title        
    And the id fragment matches the item id
    And fetching self returns an Atom::Entry
