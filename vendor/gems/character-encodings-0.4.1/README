To compile:

$ rake

To test:

$ rake spec

Take a look at the files in “specifications” to see some examples of how to
load the library and use the methods.

It’s basically the following:

require 'encoding/character/utf-8'

str = +"äbc"
str_that_is_the_same_as_previous_str = u"äbc"

There’s no install task yet, so until then, just load Ruby as follows:

$ ruby -Ilib:ext

and you’ll be able to require the library as shown above.

I’ll try to learn Ruby Gems tonight, so hopefully there’ll be a way to install
this library as a gem by tomorrow!
