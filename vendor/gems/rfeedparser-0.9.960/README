= Universal Feed Parser
  http://rfeedparser.rubyforge.org
  Original Python code Copyright (c) 2002-5 by Mark Pilgrim
  Ruby port by Jeff Hodges.

== Description

Parse nearly any RSS and Atom feeds in Ruby.  3000 unit tests.  Open source.

== Installation

For Debian-based systems:

  $ sudo apt-get install libxml-ruby1.8 # or libxml-parser-ruby1.8

TODO: dependency installation instructions for other platforms.

And then:

  $ sudo gem install rfeedparser

Or for the latest development version:

  $ git clone git://github.com/technomancy/rfeedparser.git

Dependencies on other gems are handled by rubygems, but rfeedparser
also relies on having bindings to a native XML parsing library. The
recommended choice is libxml, which is installable with the
libxml-ruby1.8 package in Debian-based systems. But it can also fall
back to expat (the libxml-parser-ruby1.8 Debian package) if libxml is
not installed.

== Usage

   require 'rubygems' # may omit if installed manually
   require 'rfeedparser'

   feed = FeedParser.parse("some-feed-stream-filepath-or-url")

   feed.entries.each do |e|
     puts e.title
     puts e.content
     puts e.published
     puts '----'
   end
