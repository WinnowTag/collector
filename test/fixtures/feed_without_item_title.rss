&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;by digby&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;Reading &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2151353/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Jacob Weisberg on the subject of Bush's creation of the Axis of Evil, I realized that one of the most frustrating aspects of right wing hawkish thinking is their belief that it is useless to have any kind of short-term solution to a problem unless it can be guaranteed to result in a long term resolution.  Indeed, they even think of truces and ceasefires as weakness.  Here's Bush a couple of months ago talking about Lebanon:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;"Our mission and our goal is to have a lasting peace -- not a temporary peace, but something that lasts," said Bush. "We want a sustainable ceasefire. We don't want something that's, you know, short term in duration."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;Right.  Tell it to the people who died or were wounded because that "short term" solution just wasn't good enough for George W. Bush.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;That is just one very bizarre aspect of their black and white thinking that leads to such things as their ridiculous posturing on North Korea in which no interim agreement (like that achieved by Clinton with the Agreed Framework) is countenanced because they will only accept a permanent solution.  I suppose one could say that this might be a useful way to run a kindergarten, but real violence in the real world is something that should always be punted if at all possible. This is not because of a general moral revulsion toward violence, although that should certainly be a factor. Nor is it simply that to delay would save lives "in the short term."  It's because we cannot tell the future. Kim Jong Il could die from a heart attack. A short term cease fire in Lebanon could have given everyone a chance to catch their breath and perhaps recognize that escalating the war was indefensible. Anything can happen.  A break from violence creates a possibility that it won't start up again.  A crazy dictator delaying the development of a nuclear bomb opens up the possibility that he won't develop one.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;I realize that Bush and his pals think that their "enemies" are nihilistic at best and animals at worst.  But they are humans and humans are always subject to change from within or without.  The idea that it is "useless" to put off something like a &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;a war&lt;/span&gt; or a &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;nuclear showdown&lt;/span&gt; until tomorrow when you can have one today (or put off a ceasefire 'til tomorrow when you can have one today) is beyond stupid or irresponsible.  It's sick.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;* I should note that the right has come to think that anything short of a hostile, aggressive military response to everything is "appeasement."  It isn't. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;"The word in its normal meaning connotes the pacific settlement of disputes; in the meaning usually applied to the period of Chamberlain's premiership, it has come to indicate something sinister, &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;the granting from fear or cowardice of unwarranted concessions in order to buy temporary peace at someone else's expense&lt;/span&gt;." D.N. DIlks, Appeasement Revisited, Journal of Contemporary History, 1972.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;

They have repeatedly charged that while Bush has said the country is at war he has refused to call off the tax breaks for the rich or implement any measures that would require the American people to sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not true. In pursuit of war, he has instituted, and the American public through its apathy has gone along with, an extremely profound hardship.  &lt;a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/10/bush-administrations-torture-of-us.html"&gt;Bush has sacrificed American democracy:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In an effort to gain Mr. Padilla’s "dependency and trust," he was tortured for nearly the entire three years and eight months of his unlawful detention. The torture took myriad forms, each designed to cause pain, anguish, depression and, ultimately, the loss of will to live. The base ingredient in Mr. Padilla’s torture was stark isolation for a substantial portion of his captivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly two years – from June 9, 2002 until March 2, 2004, when the Department of Defense permitted Mr. Padilla to have contact with his lawyers – Mr. Padilla was in complete isolation. Even after he was permitted contact with counsel, his conditions of confinement remained essentially the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was kept in a unit comprising sixteen individual cells, eight on the upper level and eight on the lower level, where Mr. Padilla’s cell was located. No other cells in the unit were occupied. His cell was electronically monitored twenty-four hours a day, eliminating the need for a guard to patrol his unit. His only contact with another person was when a guard would deliver and retrieve trays of food and when the government desired to interrogate him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His isolation, furthermore, was aggravated by the efforts of his captors to maintain complete sensory deprivation. His tiny cell – nine feet by seven feet – had no view to the outside world. The door to his cell had a window, however, it was covered by a magnetic sticker, depriving Mr. Padilla of even a view into the hallway and adjacent common areas of his unit. He was not given a clock or a watch and for most of the time of his captivity, he was unaware whether it was day or night, or what time of year or day it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to his extreme isolation, Mr. Padilla was also viciously deprived of sleep. This sleep deprivation was achieved in a variety of ways. For a substantial period of his captivity, Mr. Padilla’s cell contained only a steel bunk with no mattress. The pain and discomfort of sleeping on a cold, steel bunk made it impossible for him to sleep. Mr. Padilla was not given a mattress until the tail end of his captivity. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other times, his captors would bang the walls and cell bars creating loud startling noises. These disruptions would occur throughout the night and cease only in the morning, when Mr. Padilla’s interrogations would begin. Efforts to manipulate Mr. Padilla and break his will also took the form of the denial of the few benefits he possessed in his cell. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Padilla’s dehumanization at the hands of his captors also took more sinister forms. Mr. Padilla was often put in stress positions for hours at a time. He would be shackled and manacled, with a belly chain, for hours in his cell. Noxious fumes would be introduced to his room causing his eyes and nose to run. The temperature of his cell would be manipulated, making his cell extremely cold for long stretches of time. Mr. Padilla was denied even the smallest, and most personal shreds of human dignity by being deprived of showering for weeks at a time, yet having to endure forced grooming at the whim of his captors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A substantial quantum of torture endured by Mr. Padilla came at the hands of his interrogators. In an effort to disorient Mr. Padilla, his captors would deceive him about his location and who his interrogators actually were. Mr. Padilla was threatened with being forcibly removed from the United States to another country, including U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he was threatened his fate would be even worse than in the Naval Brig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was threatened with being cut with a knife and having alcohol poured on the wounds. He was also threatened with imminent execution. He was hooded and forced to stand in stress positions for long durations of time. He was forced to endure exceedingly long interrogation sessions, without adequate sleep, wherein he would be confronted with false information, scenarios, and documents to further disorient him. Often he had to endure multiple interrogators who would scream, shake, and otherwise assault Mr. Padilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, Mr. Padilla was given drugs against his will, believed to be some form of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or phencyclidine (PCP), to act as a sort of truth serum during his interrogations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout most of the time Mr. Padilla was held captive in the Naval Brig he had no contact with the outside world. In March 2004, one year and eight months after arriving in the Naval Brig, Mr. Padilla was permitted his first contact with his attorneys. Even thereafter, although Mr. Padilla had access to counsel, and thereby some contact with the outside world, those visits were extremely limited and restricted. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deprivations, physical abuse, and other forms of inhumane treatment visited upon Mr. Padilla caused serious medical problems that were not adequately addressed. Apart from the psychological damage done to Mr. Padilla, there were numerous health problems brought on by the conditions of his captivity. Mr. Padilla frequently experienced cardiothoracic difficulties while sleeping, or attempting to fall asleep, including a heavy pressure on his chest and an inability to breath or move his body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one incident Mr. Padilla felt a burning sensation pulsing through his chest. He requested medical care but was given no relief. Toward the end of his captivity, Mr. Padilla experienced swelling and pressure in his chest and arms. He was administered an electrocardiogram, and given medication. . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cause of some of the medical problems experienced by Mr. Padilla is obvious. Being cramped in a tiny cell with little or no opportunity for recreation and enduring stress positions and shackling for hours caused great pain and discomfort. It is unclear, though, whether Mr. Padilla’s cardiothoracic problems were a symptom of the stress he endured in captivity, or a side effect from one of the drugs involuntarily induced into Mr. Padilla’s system in the Naval Brig. In either event, the strategically applied measures suffered by Mr. Padilla at the hands of the government caused him both physical and psychological pain and agony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth noting that throughout his captivity, none of the restrictive and inhumane conditions visited upon Mr. Padilla were brought on by his behavior or by any actions on his part. There were no incidents of Mr. Padilla violating any regulation of the Naval Brig or taking any aggressive action towards any of his captors. Mr. Padilla has always been peaceful and compliant with his captors. He was, and remains to the time of this filing, docile and resigned – a model detainee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Padilla also wants to make clear that the deprivation described above did abate somewhat once counsel began negotiating with the officials of the Naval Brig for the improvements of his conditions. Toward the end of Mr. Padilla’s captivity in the Naval Brig he was provided reading materials and some other more humane treatment. However, despite some improvement in Mr. Padilla’s living conditions, the interrogations and torture continued even after the visits with counsel commenced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, many of the conditions Mr. Padilla experienced were inhumane and caused him great physical and psychological pain and anguish. Other deprivations experienced by Mr. Padilla, taken in isolation, are merely cruel and some, merely petty. However, it is important to recognize that all of the deprivations and assaults recounted above were employed in concert in a calculated manner to cause him maximum anguish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also extremely important to note that the torturous acts visited upon Mr. Padilla were done over the course almost the entire three years and seven months of his captivity in the Naval Brig. For most of one thousand three hundred and seven days, Mr. Padilla was tortured by the United States government without cause or justification. Mr. Padilla’s treatment at the hands of the United States government is shocking to even the most hardened conscience, and such outrageous conduct on the part of the government divests it of jurisdiction, under the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment, to prosecute Mr. Padilla in the instant matter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Now for the benefit of the cognitively damaged out there in the blogosphere, let me insert some boilerplate here to the effect that I have no idea what Padilla may or may not have done. That is an entirely separate issue. The issue here is illegal detention and torture of one its citizens by that citizen's government. That kind of behavior by &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; state, for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; reason, is inexcusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After racking my brain, I can come up with only one reason why Padilla was held for 3 1/2 years without charges and tortured. It was not because Padilla had 3 1/2 years of information that needed to be elicited it from him. It was not because what he may have known was a state secret. Padilla was imprisoned and suffered simply because Bush wanted to prove he had the power to do so. To anyone, even Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Why would Bush want to do that?  What does he - more importantly, what does the country - gain from this kind of totalitarian behavior? Well, once again, Bush is making a point, that the president has the power to do whatever the president wants, without having to provide reasons to anyone. Especially during "wartime." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Bush thinks, and the Bush administration thinks, and Republicans think, that it is a Good Thing. They must destroy America in order to save it. Shrink the American government down to nothing, so it drowns, as Norquist once said. What no one ever asked Norquist was what Republicans would replace the American government &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now we know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sickening. Absolutely sickening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edited slightly after initial posting.]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Divided Families&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;by poputonian&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;Anyone who missed Olbermann's powerful chronicle about President Bush's most recent spate of lies should visit &lt;a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/10/05/olbermanns-special-comment-it-is-not-the-democrats-whose-inaction-in-the-face-of-the-enemy-you-fear/"&gt;Crooks and Liars&lt;/a&gt; for a look-see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; Olbermann said:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And lastly tonight, a Special Comment, about -- lying.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;The President of the United States -- unbowed, undeterred, and unconnected to reality -- has continued his extraordinary trek through our country rooting out the enemies of freedom: The Democrats.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;Yesterday at a fundraiser for an Arizona Congressman, Mr. Bush claimed, quote, "177 of the opposition party said 'You know, we don't think we ought to be listening to the conversations of terrorists."&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;The hell they did.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;177 Democrats opposed the President's seizure of another part of the Constitution.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;Tuesday, at another fundraiser in California, he had said "Democrats take a law enforcement approach to terrorism. That means America will wait until we're attacked again before we respond."&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;Mr. Bush fabricated that, too.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;And evidently he has begun to fancy himself as a mind-reader.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;"If you listen closely to some of the leaders of the Democratic Party," the President said at another fundraiser Monday in Nevada, "it sounds like they think the best way to protect the American people is — wait until we're attacked again."&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;It defies belief that this President and his administration could continue to find new unexplored political gutters into which they could wallow.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;Yet they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;One of the things that bothers me about neo-Republicanism and  its entire foundation of lies, is the division it has created within families. I can hardly speak to my wingnut brother anymore, and we can't speak at all about politics. We had numerous heated debates in the first couple of years following the invasion of Iraq, but he would counter every sourceable evidence I put forward with a lie he had been fed by Fox News, Rush Phlegmball, or &lt;i&gt;The President&lt;/i&gt; -- people who really have no honor whatsoever.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;When I informed an uncle (in his sixties) about PNAC as evidence of pre-meditation of the war in Iraq, he asked me with complete and genuine concern if I had been getting information from the Internet, as if the Internet was a big tub of lies, with no sources to back up any assertion. His source of information about Iraq? He admitted it: newspaper editorials and the aforementioned Mr. Phlegmball.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;It seems every political debate conducted in the family setting ends in emotional turmoil. If you're serious about the politics of death and dying, your own flesh and blood are the ones you most want to convince of how wrong and dishonorable the current administration is. But convincing the last thirty percent of deeply entrenched wingnuts, even if they're family, isn't going to happen given that the current Republican leadership is the most dishonorable lot of American politicians ever. They have institutionalized and legitimated the art of lying to where it is now an officially accepted practice. I really think they see lying as an important part of the political gamesmanship, the country be damned.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>AMERICAN POWER.</strong>  Responding to a relatively unobjectionable <strong>Tom Friedman</strong> <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/opinion/11friedman.html">column</a> calling for "Russia and China [to] get over their ambivalence about U.S. power", <strong>Matt</strong> <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2006/10/the_bus/">notes</a> that "ambivalence about U.S. power is a natural thing for Russia and China to feel."</p>

<p>More than that, particularly for China, <em>concern</em> over US power is a natural way to feel.  After all, it wasn't that long ago that some nobody named <strong>Paul Wolfowitz</strong> <a href="http://work.colum.edu/~amiller/wolfowitz1992.htm">drafted</a> a document for then-Defense Secretary <strong>Dick Cheney</strong> arguing that "America’s political and military mission in the post-cold-war era will be to ensure that no rival superpower is allowed to emerge in Western Europe, Asia or the territories of the former Soviet Union."  In other words, US foreign policy should be explicitly aimed at stopping other large countries from becoming competing superpowers.  </p>

<p>Do you think China, with four-and-a-half times our population, thinks America should be the most powerful and dominant country in the world, forevermore?  Or Russia, with their land mass, proud history, and in-living-memory superpower status?  For these countries, and many others, America's power is not obviously benign, and there's every indication it could eventually be turned on them were they to pose even a nonaggressive threat to it.  And that probably leaves them something worse than ambivalent towards our might, attitude, and obvious affection for unipolarity. </p>
