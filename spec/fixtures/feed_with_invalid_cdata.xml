			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> This is my first attempt at delayed posting.  So if you are reading this, then all is well and I&#8217;m not an idiot.  I figured out how to get <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to publish on a set date.  Woot!</p>
<p>Before I start on my &#8220;Best of 2006&#8243; list, I&#8217;d like to make a disclaimer.  I&#8217;m basing my list off of when I discovered something, not necessarily its initial release date.  So, a CD may have been released in 2005, but if I didn&#8217;t pick it up until this year, it&#8217;s eligible for the list.  And that&#8217;s the great thing about this, I make the rules.  So, yeah, take that.</p>
<h4>Best CDs</h4>
<p>I thought about ranking these, but I can&#8217;t really.  All of these CDs make my personal list because they are so different and unique, there&#8217;s not an accurate basis for comparison. So, here ya go&#8230;in no specific order.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px">
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000F8O4DG%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000F8O4DG%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Taking the Long Way</a>&#8221; by The Dixie Chicks &#8212; If this CD doesn&#8217;t win Album of the Year at the Grammy&#8217;s, they&#8217;ll have been robbed.  I&#8217;ve loved the Chicks from their first single, but with this album, they transcend being a cutsey gal group.  They become artists.  Oh, and, yeah, up yours George W. Bush.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000B7BZM4%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000B7BZM4%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Speak Your Yourself</a>&#8221; by Imogen Heap &#8212; Without a doubt, one of the most creative and inventive musician&#8217;s recording today, Imogen is a total breath of fresh air.  Her Grammy nomination for Best New Artist is well deserved.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B00006EXLQ%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B00006EXLQ%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Details</a>&#8221; by Frou Frou &#8212; From beginnning to end, one of the best CDs I&#8217;ve ever heard.  Frou Frou, with Imogen Heap on lead vocals, proves that pop music doesn&#8217;t have to me formulaic or stiff anymore, and the word &#8220;pop&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have to be a badge of shame.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000EGCITG%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000EGCITG%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">I&#8217;m Not Dead</a>&#8221; by Pink &#8212;  Pink&#8217;s latest cut could make my list for the inclusion of one of the most politically relevant songs to come out in years, Dear Mr. President, but she didn&#8217;t stop with just one important but.  I don&#8217;t know that Pink will ever duplicate the success of her sophomore CD and honestly, I just don&#8217;t give a damn.  Each new album shows a different, more mature Alecia Moore.  Each album is full of her powerful soprano laying it on in just the right amounts.  In the end, that&#8217;s what we all want from our artists.  Talent and growth.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000GPIPVU%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000GPIPVU%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Till the Sun Turns Black</a>&#8221; by Ray Lamontagne &#8212; Ray is a folk-rock legend, and this is just his second CD.  The man has one of the most incredible voices in music today and on his most recent release, he&#8217;s proving to the world that he knows how to use it. <em>Sun</em> is a master class in how to make an album that is insightful and moving while maintaining beautiful melodies.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000ESSTMO%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000ESSTMO%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Goodbye Alice in Wonderland</a>&#8221; by Jewel &#8212; That voice.  That damn voice.  She gets me every time.  She lures me in with her kittenish verses, then the bellowy choruses riddled with passion.  There&#8217;s only one Jewel, she is a national treasure.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000G759LW%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000G759LW%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Back to Basics - Disc 2</a>&#8221; by Christina Aguilera &#8212; The second disc of this 2 CD set is flawless.  Christina and Linda Perry have crafted a CD so beautifully diverse in styles that it becomes it&#8217;s own genre.  Christina has never sounded better or more controlled.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000EBCOMW%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000EBCOMW%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Say I am You</a>&#8221; by The Weepies &#8212; I have a weakness for unapologetically sappy pop music, which is exactly what The Weepies Deliver.  When Deb starts singing, I can&#8217;t help but recall one of my all-time favorite pop vocalists: Karen Carpenter.  For a feel good CD, go no farther than <em>Say I am You</em>.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000EQ47LS%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000EQ47LS%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Nothing Left to Lose</a>&#8221; by Mat Kearney &#8212; If Chris Martin of Coldplay went solo for an album and broke out a rap or two, you&#8217;d have something very similar to Nothing Left to Lose.  Mat&#8217;s managed to make a debut album that, while his vocals do call to mind Mr. Martin, carves out his own little niche in the singer-songwriter world somewhere between Carly Simon and Linkin Park.  If you don&#8217;t own this CD, pick it up.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000CR7RDE%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000CR7RDE%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George</a>&#8221; by Jack Johnson &#8212; No one does mellow folk music like Jack.  The man is a friggin&#8217; genius at crafting the catchiest hooks and melodies with his acoustic guitar.  Proving his ability to supply hits on demand, this soundtrack CD is packed full of some of the best music of the year.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000F3AAUW%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000F3AAUW%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">St. Elswhere</a>&#8221; by Gnarls Barkley &#8212; Proving that sampling music can be an artform, not just a rip off, Gnarls&#8217; debut album is a stunning landscape of auditory delight.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000J103YI%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000J103YI%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Dreamgirls Soundtrack</a>&#8221; by Various Artists &#8212; This cast recording CD is terrific, mainly because of the natural ability of Jennifer Hudson to belt a song, while still conveying the soul of the piece as if she were singing it directly to you.   We&#8217;re watching the beginning of a legend here.</li>

<h4>The Worst CDs</h4>
<p>I know I&#8217;m probably going to draw some flack for this, but keep in mind I&#8217;m speaking my mind.  These are just my humble opinions.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px">
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000H4JGZY%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000H4JGZY%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">FutureSex/LoveSounds</a>&#8221; by Justin Timberlake &#8212; I am prepared for the hate mail, so bring it!  I&#8217;m a Justin fan, but this CD was a major disappointment.  The only two songs I care for are &#8220;What Goes Around (Comes Around)&#8221; and &#8220;Summer Love&#8221;.  Justin&#8217;s niche is being the soulful white guy who&#8217;s the heir to Michael Jackson&#8217;s King of Pop throne, but on this album he&#8217;s totally off target.  I know Justin is trying to earn &#8220;street cred&#8221; as an R&#038;B singer but this album goes too far into the thumpier, harder side of hip hop.  You&#8217;re a pretty white boy from a boy band &#8212; remember that.  Hearing him sing some of this material&#8230;I don&#8217;t know, it just feels so false.  Get back to the good stuff, Justin.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000CNDIZO%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000CNDIZO%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">The Greatest Songs of the Fifties</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000HA4AAE%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000HA4AAE%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">The Greatest Songs of the Sixties</a>&#8221; by Barry Manilow &#8212; Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.  I must have been mistaken, but I thought that you wrote the effin&#8217; songs that made the whole world sing.  What the crap are you doing making a tribute CD?  I am so sick of these songbook CDs.  I&#8217;ve got a great idea &#8212; how about you write a CD of new material, since you are a gifted musician.  Oh, and come out already.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000G759LW%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000G759LW%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Back to Basics - Disc 1</a>&#8221; by Christina Aguilera &#8212; Sorry, Xtina.  But this first CD is just rubbish, which is a damn shame because you proved with disc 2 that you can create amazing stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Best Movies</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m writing this pre-vacation and Brian and I are hoping to see a few flicks before the end of the year, so this list may be updated.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px">
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0439815/">Slither</a>&#8221; &#8212; I love scary movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, but remain campy and fun.  I hate the recent trend in horror flicks where they see how disgustingly demented they can go.  Slither is the perfect scar film: funny, great scares, the perfect amount of camp and a terrific ensemble cast that switches between scaring the crap out of us and making us guffaw with ease.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0417148/">Snakes on a Plane</a>&#8221; &#8212; This movie was AWEsome.  That&#8217;s all I can say.  Absolutely one of the best flics of 2006.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0407887/">The Departed</a>&#8221; &#8212; I have mixed emotions about this film.  It was on track until the ending, then it went waaaay off course.  But, even taking that into account, its still brilliant.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0457939/">The Holiday</a>&#8221; &#8212; This was one of the most charming romantic comedies I&#8217;ve seen in years.  And Kate Winslet.  That&#8217;s all I need to say.  Oh, and Jude Law.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#8217;s Chest</a>&#8221;  &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t overly impressed by the first movie and walked into this one expecting the worst.  But I was wrong.  This fun little film was so action packed and enjoyable that I wanted to see the first one again to see if I was completely off the mark.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0376994/">X-Men: The Last Stand</a>&#8221; &#8212; This movie has been pulled apart by critics, which just shows most of them are idiots.  It&#8217;s a comic book movie folks.  It&#8217;s not being made in attempt to capture the Best Picture Oscar.  It&#8217;s being made because comic book geeks, like myself, want to see our favorite heroes and villains blow shit up.  And when critics realize that, the world will be a much better place.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/">Casino Royale</a>&#8221; &#8212; Without a doubt, my favorite Bond flick.  Aside from Daniel Craig being a total beefcake, he brings a realness to the role that we haven&#8217;t seen before in the Bond world.  I think there will always be a place for the deliciously absurd gadgets and plots from the Bond of yore, but I&#8217;ll take my Bond with a dose of reality.  Well, and those <a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0381061/PK0400.jpg.html">swim trunks</a>.  :)</li>

<h4>The Best TV Shows</h4>
<p>Keeping in mind that I&#8217;m not going off of the year they were released, but when I viewed them, here are my favorite TV shows of 2006.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px">
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000AQ68RI%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000AQ68RI%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Buffy The Vampire Slayer (Entire Series)</a>&#8221; &#8212; Brian and I rented the first couple discs of season one from Blockbuster to see if we&#8217;d enjoy this cult classic.  And we did.  Greatly.  In fact, once we started watching the first season, we couldn&#8217;t stop until we had seen every episode.  This is without a doubt my favorite TV show in the history of all things awesome.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000I0QLS2%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000I0QLS2%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Angel (Entire Series)</a>&#8221; &#8212; Second only to Buffy, Angel is another Joss Whedon masterpiece.  We were totally bummed when we finished Buffy, but once we got into Angel, we were totally stoked.  But then we finished Angel and now we&#8217;re bummed again.  Write something new &#8212; you hear me Joss!?</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/index">Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</a>&#8221; &#8212; I have loved this show from episode one.  I think they&#8217;re having a hard time topping season two (Dylan go Boom!) but it&#8217;s still the best show on TV today.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/">The Office</a>&#8221; &#8212; Another series having trouble overcoming the wondermousness of it&#8217;s second season.  But it is still the funniest show on TV.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Best Graphic Novels</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved the comic book and it&#8217;s big brother the graphic novel.  In 2006, I spent more time enjoying this little passion.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px">
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1563894696%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1563894696%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Batman: The Long Halloween</a>&#8221; &#8212; Amazing.   This was the first graphic novel I read this year and it completely renewed my love for this artform.  The Jeph Loeb/Tim Sale combo is the Dream Team colloboration for me.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1563892731%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1563892731%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Batman: Haunted Knight</a>&#8221; &#8212; Another Loeb/Sale original that shows you how these books can rise above being lableled as geek fare, and into true classic stories with beautifully illustrated artwork.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1563898683%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1563898683%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">Batman: Dark Victory</a>&#8221; &#8212; The final Loeb/Sale novel I bought, and one of the best.  The story is a bit darker and has more of a bite.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1569714029%26tag=piggdidit-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1569714029%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82">300</a>&#8221; &#8212; I have the utmost respect for Frank Miller.  He&#8217;s brought the art of the Graphic Novel to mainstream America.  And he&#8217;s a legend in his own right.  But I&#8217;ve never enjoyed his work as I have other artists&#8217;.  That all changed with <em>300</em>.  This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful and compelling pieces of artwork to ever come out of this genre.  I can&#8217;t wait to see the film.</li>
