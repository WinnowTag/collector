<p>
  This table shows the spidering attempts performed by the collector. 
  Spidering is triggered when there are less than 60 tokens in a collected item.
</p>
<p>
  Each entry shows the feed the item was from and the URL that was spidered.
  It also shows if the spidering was successful and if the item was collected as a result of the spidering. 
  You can click on the magnifying glass to see the actual results of the spidering.
